# Description

# PART 1-Supervised Learning application
A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ the services of a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

The main approach in determining these individuals is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis in order to draw meaningful insights and applying supervised learning techniques to identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

# PART 2-Unsupervised Learning application
Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

The objective of this research would be to learn the characteristic of customer groups for this brand using unsupervised learning techniques.
